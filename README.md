# dockercmd

A helper to run Docker containers as commands.

Loosely inspired by Jessie Frazelle's blog post ( https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/ ) on the subject of running desktop apps in Docker containers, and some experiments of my own in that direction, dockercmd exists to simplify this process. It uses configuration files to define the run-time configuration of "command containers", letting you invoke them as simple commands.

## Installation

[TODO]

Since `dockercmd` is a relatively long command, I suggest adding a shorter alias for it; `dodo`, by analogy to `sudo`, or even simply `d`.

## Configuration

## Invocation

## Compensation
